## Our client is a fund management firm

- The firm aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict
the returns of a mutual fund after a 3-year investment period.
- Will it be High or Low?

## Current Practice

Traditional investment analysis techniques fall short in accurately forecasting mutual fund performance due to their reliance on historical data and qualitative factors.
